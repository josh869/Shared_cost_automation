This Python script is aimed at streamlining the process of calculating shared costs among a group of individuals who won tickets for a tour, from a company offering a 50% discount on transportation fees.

Here's the context: The tour spans a month, featuring both morning and evening trips to various sponsored events and destinations. Participants have the option to either cover their own transportation expenses or opt for a shared bus ride, subsidized by the touring company at 50%. The remaining 50% of the transportation cost is divided among the individuals based on the number of passengers on each trip. Thus, the total cost varies depending on daily attendance.

- Total cost for each bus ride: $900
- Touring company covers: $450
- Remaining $450 is shared among participants.

  I've uploaded the raw data used in this analysis for your convenience.
